Generation Take-Home Coding Challenge
=================================
This is a take-home coding challenge used to help evaluate candidates
interested in joining the team at Generation.
The goal is for candidates to complete the coding challenge before the
in-person interview so that we can discuss the solution together.
In cases where this is not possible, we may discuss the solution together
over a followup phone call.

### How should you submit your code?

Any way you want - email us a zip, a link to your personal repo, etc.
Please include a couple screenshots of the app.

### What do we look for?

* **Correctness**: does the application do what was asked (e.g., all the user stories are complete)? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* **Code quality**: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?  Are there any code smells or other red flags? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
* **Testing**: Are there some unit and some integration tests?
	* We're not looking for full coverage (given time constraint) but just trying to get a feel for your testing skills.
* **UX**:  Is the web interface understandable and pleasing to use? Is it responsive to various screen sizes, and fast to load?
* **Technical choices**: do choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?

		  <p>Below are some real-life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">user stories</a> that we face at Generation.</p>
		  <p>We'd love to see how you use JS and React to address these user stories.</p>
		  <p>Feel free to add libraries, create new components, or otherwise change the codebase. This app is yours!</p>
		  <p>Implementing the user stories listed should take between 2-5 hours. If you're having trouble, don't be afraid to ask for help!</p>

		  <strong>Student user stories:</strong>
		  <ul>
		    <li>As a student, I want to see a map of Mexico City</li>
		    <li>As a student, I want to see a map that has all the stores represented as markers/pins on the map.</li>
		    <li>As a student, I want to be able to click on a store and add it to a list of 'My Favorite Stores'</li>
		  </ul>

		  <p>Helpful tips:</p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li><i>Feel free to use our Google Maps API key: AIzaSyCVH8e45o3d-5qmykzdhGKd1-3xYua5D2A</i></li>
		  	<li><i>The list of stores is located in the file store_directory.json </i></li>
		  	<li><i>Focus on the user, not the technology. A simple implementation that impresses the user is better than a super technical solution that impresses other developers.</i></li>
		  	<li><i>That said, code that is easy to follow is always appreciated :)</i></li>
		  </ul>
